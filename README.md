## Benche Crates

This repository is used for performance testing of different crates.

### Quick start
For example, to compare performance between `tokio` and `flume` channels, you need to perform the following two steps.
#### step 1
```shell
CRATE_NAME=tokio cargo bench --bench channel
```
got output:
```md
current crate:`tokio`
mpsc-string             time:   [32.463 ns 32.615 ns 32.763 ns]                         
Found 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)
  3 (3.00%) high mild

```
#### step 2

Switching to flume channel:
```shell
CRATE_NAME=flume cargo bench --bench channel
```

### clickhouse-rs vs clickhouse.rs vs klickhouse vs grpc

[clickhouse-rs](https://crates.io/crates/clickhouse-rs)

[clickhouse.rs](https://crates.io/crates/clickhouse)

[klickhouse](https://crates.io/crates/klickhouse)

[grpc](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/grpc)
#### Pre-Requirements
You'll need a machine running clickhouse-server, and having completed ClickHouse's [Advanced Tutorial](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/tutorial).

#### Result
run this command:
```shell
CRATE_NAME=kk-rs cargo bench --bench ch-sdk
CRATE_NAME=ck-rs cargo bench --bench ch-sdk
CRATE_NAME=ck.rs cargo bench --bench ch-sdk
CRATE_NAME=ck-grpc cargo bench --bench ch-sdk
```
And you got this result:

`grpc` > `clickhouse.rs` > `clickhouse-rs` >> `klickhouse`

### arrow-parquet vs parquet2
The results show that parquet2 is not as good as it claims to be (synchronized reads), but this is of course related to the fact that parquet2 has almost stopped being maintained. From a usage point of view, parquet2 can be controlled at a much finer granularity than arrow-parquet (from the official repository samples)

                        Performance has regressed.
